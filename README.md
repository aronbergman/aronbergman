# 📅 [Agenda 42](https://agenda42.fr)

**Agenda42** is a web application that helps students at [École 42](https://42.fr) efficiently manage their time and campus activities — all in one place:  
- Slots where you’re assigned as a peer evaluator  
- Your own project evaluations  
- Events you’ve signed up for  

No more unexpected `-TIG` for missed events!  
In addition to tracking, the app also provides **full control over slots and events**.
